# Getting Started

This project was created using Create React App.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

The page reloads automatically when changes are made.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` directory.

The build is optimized and minified for best performance.  
Generated files include hashed filenames.

### `npm run eject`

Removes the default build configuration and exposes all underlying config files.

This action is irreversible.  
Use only if you need full control over the build setup.
